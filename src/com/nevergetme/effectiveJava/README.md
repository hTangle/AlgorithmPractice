# Effective Java

## 1. Create and Destroy objects
* ### Consider static factory methods instead of constructors
  1. #### one advantage of static factory methods is that, unlike constructors, they have name
  2. #### a second advantage of static factroy methods is that, unlike constructors, they are not required to create a new objects each time they are invoked
